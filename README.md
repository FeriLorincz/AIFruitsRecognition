## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Developers

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/FeriLorincz/AIFruitsRecognition.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Machine Learning Model**
   - Navigate to the `model` directory to find the Python code
   - Open the model in Google Colab for cloud-based training

3. **Run the Android Application**
   - Open the `android` directory in Android Studio
   - Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device

### For Non-Technical Users

The Android application (coming soon to Google Play) will allow you to:
- Take pictures of fruits using your phone camera
- Get instant identification results
- Learn interesting facts about the identified fruits

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Expand the model to recognize more fruit varieties
- Add nutritional information for identified fruits
- Create an iOS version of the application
- Implement offline recognition capabilities
